A solar flare is a sudden, intense burst of energy and radiation from the Sun.These flares occur when 
magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is released in the form of light, heat, and 
energetic particles. Solar flares can be classified based on their intensity, with categories ranging 
from A, B, C, M, and X, with X-class flares being the most powerful.

that is why using ml algorithms to predict time and coditions of solar flare happen.
